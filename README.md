# NeuralNetPlayground

Welcome to NeuralNetPlayground! This repository contains various neural network projects, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Project 1: Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using a Neural Network (NN).

### Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one)
- NumPy, Pandas
- StandardScaler for data standardization
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if used for development)

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be imported from sklearn or downloaded from Kaggle 


### Clone the repo:
